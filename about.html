            <p style="margin-top: 1.125em">I'm a fourth year computer science student at University of San Diego. I grew up in Vista, California with both of my parents majoring in computer science when they were in school. After middle school I had the opportunity to go mission vista high school, where they offered courses programming in Java. From there I developed a passion for programming, and constantly tried to improve myself with frequent personal projects.</p>
